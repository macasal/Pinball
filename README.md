# Simple Pinball

###### _Authors: sgalella, mikirubio_

We add our first own-written program. It was done during our first course in Programming and written in C.

It consists in a simplification of a pinball game and basically has 4 options:
###### 1.Visualizing the game table
###### 2.Print some statistics about the table
###### 3.Simulating 1 ball falling and watching the route it takes in the table
###### 4.Simulating 10 balls fall and observing how many ball have gone through each position in the table
	
Remember to compile it using GNU (gcc) compiler
